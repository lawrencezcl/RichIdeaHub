## 🔧 Issues Identified

### 1. Database Empty (Critical)
- **Issue**: No cases in database causing most case-related tests to fail
- **Impact**: High - affects case detail pages, case cards, filtering
- **Solution**: Need to populate database with test data or trigger data collection

### 2. UI Element Visibility (Medium)
- **Issue**: Some buttons and controls are hidden or not properly styled
- **Impact**: Medium - affects user interaction
- **Solution**: Review CSS and responsive design

### 3. Button Accessibility (Low)
- **Issue**: Some buttons missing accessible names
- **Impact**: Low - mostly navigation buttons
- **Solution**: Add aria-label attributes where needed

## 🎯 Recommendations
